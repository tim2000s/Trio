# REVIEW.md

The checks a change to this repository is reviewed against before it is committed. This is the
Boost-in-Trio port: Trio with the AndroidAPS Boost algorithm run as a mode-gated second pass over
the oref determination, and with Adaptive Smoothing (the UKF port) in the glucose path. Each item
is written so that a reviewer can test a diff against it and name the item a finding breaks.
Findings are labelled important (fix before commit), nit (optional) or pre-existing (present before
this change; record it, do not block on it).

The tiers and the checks each tier requires are set in the global instructions and summarised here
for this repository. The incident record is spread across CLAUDE.md (mistakes 1 to 7, smoothing),
`BoostPort/docs/AUDIT.md`, `BoostPort/AUDIT_2026-06-28.md` and the commit messages of the Boost
line; the table at the end maps each incident to what now catches it.

## Tiers in this repository

High: anything that can change a dose, a safety limit or whether the loop runs.
`BoostPort/BoostV5Core/Sources/**` (the V5/V6 engine, DynISF, safety gates, caps, tranche, primer,
auto-config, sleep detector, night mode and activity classifier), `Trio/Sources/APS/**` (the
override seam in `OpenAPS/OpenAPS.swift`, `APSManager.swift` including `performBolus` and the
auto-config wiring, `OpenAPSSwift/**` including `DetermineBasal/` and `Boost/`,
`FetchGlucoseManager.swift` and `Storage/GlucoseStorage.swift`, since the smoothed value is what
the algorithm reads when smoothing is on), `GlucoseSmoothing/**`, `trio-oref/**`,
`AlgorithmPackage/**`, `Trio/Resources/boost/*.json` (the two bundled models),
`Trio/Sources/Services/HealthKit/BoostActivityMonitor.swift` (it feeds the gate and the inactivity
raise), `Trio/Sources/Models/Preferences.swift` where a default or decode clamp of a dosing key
changes, `DeviceDataManager.swift` (it syncs Max Bolus to the drivers), the pump and CGM
submodules (`OmnipodKit`, `MinimedKit`, `DanaKit`, `MedtrumKit`, `RileyLinkKit`, `AccuChekKit`,
`RoundWhiteDiscKit`, `CGMBLEKit`, `G7SensorKit`, `LibreTransmitter`, `LibreLoop`, `EversenseKit`,
`dexcom-share-client-swift`, `LoopKit`, `LoopAlgorithm`) including a change of pinned commit, and
any `Trio.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` change that adds or drops a source in those paths. Before
commit: `cd BoostPort/BoostV5Core && swift test`, `swift test --package-path GlucoseSmoothing` for
the smoothing path, `swift test --package-path AlgorithmPackage`, a full simulator build of the
`Trio` scheme, the checklist, a replay against real history when behaviour changes (items 23 to 25)
and a fresh-context review of the diff. Before an installable build is handed over: the full
simulator build and the hosted `Trio Tests` scheme, with the previous build named as the way back.

Medium: code that runs on the device without changing a dose. Settings views under
`Trio/Sources/Modules/**`, reason-string telemetry, Nightscout upload, the watch app, complications
and Live Activity. Unit tests where they exist, the checklist, and the full simulator build.

Low: `BOOST.md`, `BoostPort/docs/**`, `BoostPort/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `BoostPort/sim/**`, the replay
test harnesses under `Tests/BoostV5CoreTests/Replay/`, READMEs and CLAUDE.md. The analysis
checklist in the global instructions and items 23 to 27 below.

## Dosing path

1. Every dosing-affecting change is gated on `boostMode == .active`. With the mode `Off` or
   `Shadow` the determination (units, rate, insulinReq, forecasts) is byte-identical to stock
   Trio. No test asserts this; the reviewer checks each new branch for the gate.
2. New dosing logic ships default off or shadow-only, reaches Active only after its shadow output
   has been looked at, and in shadow is computed from the Boost-flavoured determination rather
   than the stock one, so the logged would-be dose predicts what Active would do.
3. The commit message of a high-tier change states its direction (adds insulin, removes insulin,
   or neither), as the October 2026 port commits do. A change that adds insulin or removes a limit
   names the AAPS commit it matches and the evidence for it.
4. Safety limits only tighten unless a removal is matched to AAPS and justified in the commit: the
   minGuardBG hard gate, the non-finite-input hard gate in `SafetyGates.applyPhase3`, the composed
   floor's fail-closed TBR gate (TBR<63 below 2.0% and TBR<70 below 3.5%, at least 1000 readings),
   the auto-config TBR raise-guard (no cap raise applied above 4% time below 70), the post-rescue
   caps and rebound guard, the non-meal cap at the base dose, the rolling 60-minute cumulative SMB
   cap, the tranche ceiling and the overnight gate. A statistic or a learned value never overrides
   one of them.
5. The override honours the user's SMB-off levers through
   `DosingEngine.smbHardDisabledByUserLevers`, and the automatic SMB still passes the Max Bolus
   clamp in `APSManager.performBolus`.
6. A claim that a safety property is absent is scoped to the layer that was read. Max Bolus for
   automatic boluses is enforced in `performBolus` and, independently, in some pump drivers
   (OmnipodKit's `OmniPumpManager.enactBolus` refuses an amount above `state.maxBolusUnits` at the
   pinned commit), and the drivers differ from one another. Read the submodule at its pinned
   commit before saying a driver lacks a check.
7. The bolus-calculator what-if path (`simulation: true`) writes no Boost state and skips the V5
   second pass. A new store write or ring-buffer push is checked against that flag.
8. Boost state is read and written through the atomic `mutateState`, never a separate load and
   save, so an overlapping scheduled loop and post-bolus determination cannot both act on the same
   state.
9. A new dosing preference is clamped to its slider range on decode in `Preferences.swift`, so an
   imported or corrupted settings file cannot feed an out-of-range or zero divisor to the engine.
   Auto-config may seed a cap only while the per-knob user-touched flag is unset.
10. A window meant as a duration is expressed in wall-clock time, not in invocations or cycles,
    since the loop cadence varies between one and five minutes. The ML lag buffer is the exception:
    its six lags stay at five-minute spacing, which is what the model was trained on, and entries
    older than 35 minutes expire.
11. No training or fitting runs on the device in the dose path. The two LightGBM models in
    `Trio/Resources/boost/` stay byte-identical to the AAPS export, and a model update changes the
    feature builder and the model in the same commit. The learned aggregates (`SleepHistoryTracker`,
    `MealTimeLearner`) stay bounded as they are; the learned wake may only move later.
12. The sleep detector and the activity snapshot are advanced from the loop, not only from
    HealthKit callbacks, and a missing, sparse or frozen heart rate is read as no signal. The
    inactivity raise, which adds insulin, needs the gate open, heart rate in zone 1 when heart-rate
    integration is on, and the person neither asleep nor inside the night window nor in a lie-in.
13. Parity is measured against the AAPS build the developer runs, named by branch or commit in the
    commit message, not against upstream AndroidAPS. A deliberate divergence from the Kotlin goes
    in its own commit after the faithful port and is recorded in the differences section of
    `BOOST.md`.

## Adaptive Smoothing

14. The smoother is the single persistent `sharedSmoother`; nothing constructs a fresh
    `UnscentedKalmanFilter()` per cycle. Guard: `no-fresh-ukf.sh`, a PreToolUse hook that
    blocks the edit. The copy under `.codex/hooks/ukf/` is tracked; the one under `.claude/hooks/ukf/`
    is git-excluded, so a Claude session in a fresh clone does not have it. `UkfPersistenceTests`
    covers the core's carried state.
15. Input to the smoother is newest-first, bucketed to five minutes and covers 34 h (limit 500).
    Guard: `UkfOrderingRegressionTest` for the order.
16. A change in the smoothing path is proven by the full-history rolling-window replay across
    Swift, Kotlin and Python in the private `trio-ukf-backtest` repository before parity is
    claimed. Per-call golden vectors and `UkfPythonParityTests` are necessary and not sufficient.

## Builds and merges

17. A new source file under `Trio/Sources/APS/OpenAPSSwift/Boost/` or `BoostPort/BoostV5Core/` is
    added to `Trio.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (the Boost directory uses explicit file references),
    and no file carries `import BoostV5Core`, because the core is compiled into the Trio target.
18. Build success is read from `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **` and xcodebuild's own exit code, never
    through a pipe. Package tests passing is not an app build: a change touching the app target is
    built with the full simulator build before commit, and a commit message says so when it was
    not.
19. After merging nightscout `dev` or `main`: `git submodule sync && git submodule update --init
    --recursive`, the full simulator build, `swift test --package-path AlgorithmPackage`, and the
    hosted `Trio Tests` scheme.
20. Hosted tests run without `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`, which strips the keychain entitlement.

## Repository and publishing

21. `origin` (the fork) is public and the Boost branch tracks it, so every push publishes. Files
    are staged by explicit path, and every staged file passes
    `~/StudioProjects/Boost-AAPS-core/backtesting/scripts/tooling/anonymise_check.py`. Cohort
    names, emails, tokens, Nightscout URLs and site hosts never appear; the developer's own name
    may.
22. Replay fixtures (`BoostPort/**/Fixtures/*.ndjson`) and soak data hold real glucose and insulin
    records and stay git-ignored; a simulator seed patch carrying a Nightscout URL or secret is
    applied for a build and reverted, never committed.

## Analysis and replay

23. The replay suites run with `swift test -c release`; in debug they take long enough over the
    fixture to look hung.
24. Each replay assertion is scoped to the reference build it validates and its per-user settings
    (the insulin divisor per profile, the Aggression knob per user) are fitted from the record, not
    assumed. A residual is classified as a missing input, an opt-in lever or a genuine
    port-against-reference difference before it is called a port defect.
25. A port-against-AAPS soak names what differs before it compares totals: the Boost and SMB
    settings in force on each side, the loop interval, treatments and temp targets not
    downloaded, and the absence of step and heart-rate data in the simulator. Auto-config values
    derived from the soak's own history are an artefact of the soak, not a setting.
26. Nightscout devicestatus records a decision whether or not it was delivered and holds some loops
    twice; it is deduplicated before counting and is not read as delivered insulin.
27. Absolute insulin figures are not pooled across the developer's insulin concentration changes
    (4 August 2026 12:25 and 17 October 2026 16:18), and cross-user unit comparisons are flagged.
